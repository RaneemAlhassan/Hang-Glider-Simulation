# Hang-Glider-Simulation
this project was prepared by me and my colleagues : 
Shaza Gheiba , 
Bushra Radi , 
Roua Takriti ,
Tsneem Kher Aldeen. 
Using modern openGL(LWJGL), JavaFX, JavaSwing, we've simulated a hang glider movement, with the ability to change the values ​​of many variables such as wind speed and direction, wing surface area, pilot weight, pilot initial speed, and other values.
